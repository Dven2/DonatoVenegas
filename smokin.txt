can only live like this.
You wouldn't understand.
Live like this?
Can I only live like this?
You...
What were you
doing in the park earlier?
What did you do?
Did you hit a woman?
Doing something
so disgusting in secret.
You don't understand me at all.
That has nothing
to do with you, right?
Doing something so disgusting
by secretly peeping on me. That's disgusting.
You're the one always
asking Mom for money.
You're still a cowardly
fake drug dealer at this age.
And that pathetic tattoo.
Could it be a match with your mom?
Is that right?
Are you a match with your mom?
Hit me.
Hit me!
Come on, hit me!
Come on, hit me!
After that, I was busy
preparing to move.
Time passed quickly.
Although I didn't completely
reconcile with Rakuto,
at least we were able to talk again.
But it still felt awkward.
My inconspicuous life as
a fake drug dealer in Tokyo came to an end.
On the Shinkansen back to Osaka,
I could see Mount Fuji.
On the opposite side of
when I went to Tokyo.
Although it was the same Mount Fuji,
it felt like it was
saying goodbye to me.
That day, it didn't even show its face.
And finally,
I felt a sense of reality.
I was really going back to Osaka.
Without any destination in Tokyo.
After eight years,
the decision I made was...
To buy a Shinkansen
ticket back to Osaka.
Sota, we're opening a shop.
Come quickly.
Coming.
- Dad.
- What?
What should we do about the mayonnaise?
- Use a generous amount.
- got it.
It's quite expensive.
Come on, cut me some slack
and make it cheaper.
Here we go again.
I can't handle you.
Grass, the rice is ready.
What are we having today?
Looks delicious.
I should have ordered the same.
What is that?
Is there a problem?
Potato plus potato plus cherry.
Because today is Christmas, right?
Yeah, because it's Christmas.
Even though it has
nothing to do with Christmas.
Then let's just say
"Happy Birthday" instead.
What are you talking about?
That's how it is.
- That's right.
- Do you have any objections?
Are you doing well?
Yes, I'm being good.
(Osaka-style okonomiyaki)
It's so cold.
Dad.
It's time to eat.
Okay, got it.
It must have been
born in the summer.
It's already grown so big.
Although I don't know who its dad is.
- What about mom?
- mom?
Its mom should be around here.
They don't have any parent-child relationship.
They can have kittens with anyone.
Not yet.
They will multiply quickly.
By the way,
they live such carefree lives.
Every day, they are free and easy.
But even so,
they are still a family.
Right?
Ouch, it hurts.
Hurry up and eat,
Mom will complain.
I know.
Alright, that's enough.
Let's play later.
Okay.
It's Christmas,
but there's no snow.
The heavens don't
know how to set the mood.
Such a cold temperature in vain.
That Christmas tree
was bought the year you were born.
Although we've kept
it stored all this time.
Even though it's an ordinary day.
Wake up in the morning,
say good morning to Mom and Dad.
Make Osaka-style okonomiyaki.
And say goodnight in the evening.
I used to dislike this kind of home.
But now, I think it's not bad.
Having family members to say
"good morning" and "goodnight" to is limited.
Perhaps, for me,
the little happiness I can find in
Osaka-style okonomiyaki is just right.
I thought I understood,
but in reality, I don't understand anything.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
You've worked hard.
What's going on?
Because it's Christmas, right?
It looks so beautiful. Thank you.
I asked the sun, it said it had
never decorated a Christmas tree before.
That's true.
That's great.
He must have fallen asleep.
The sun really wanted that star on top.
He said he wanted to give it
to Mom when she comes back.
He's trying so hard to stay awake.
Here you go.
I will work hard.

- I'll go talk to him.
- Big brother, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, get your suit ready.
- Okay.
What a hassle.
And then, the two of them
got into a fight at the nightclub.
Your little brother messed him up like that.
I understand. How about we talk
separately about this matter?
After all, it was done by someone in our family.
We also have a responsibility
for not disciplining him properly.
Alright, let's explain it clearly.
Hey, we're going to talk about
some gang-related stuff now.
You go outside.
Okay, I'll go out.
- You go out too. I'll handle it for you.
- Alright.
I'm really sorry.
Our brat caused you so much trouble.
And you had to make a special trip for this
It's alright, it's not me who got hurt.
It's not me who's in pain.
Even though he's a troublemaker
who deceives people.
He should still have money.
Make him compensate you
with 5 million. Is that enough for you?
That's more than enough.
By the way, is it really appropriate
to give us so much?
Why not? It's not my money anyway.
How about this? I'll give that kid
1 million for his recovery.
We'll split the remaining 4 million.
How can that be? After all,
we're the ones who messed up.
- We have no reason to take that much.
- Let's just go with it.
After all, it was you who
opened up this opportunity.
Let's split the money peacefully.
A win-win, right?
A win-win?
(Highest education level: Graduated
from Anryou Middle School in Naha City)
(Personal requirements column)
(I will work hard for my family)
You don't seem suitable for our family.
Sorry, we've already found someone.
Hmm, your tattoos are a bit...
No work experience?
That won't do.
Not bad, not bad.
Look at this packaging. It's cute, right?
Young people nowadays
like this kind of thing.
- Big brother, you're wise.
- I'll take care of it.
- We have various evasion methods.
- Please come this way.
Really, all the Japanese police are idiots.
Are you doing well?
You're sweating a lot.
You're so nervous.
Please have a seat first.
So, why are you here?
Well...
For some reason,
I'm looking for a regular job.
But I can't find one
with my appearance.
So I was thinking if
there's any job I can do here.
Of course, there is.
You're a delinquent, after all.
But don't worry,
we don't care about that here.
But I don't want to be in the underworld.
Listen, being in the yakuza isn't
something you can just decide to do.
So don't worry about it.
It's just a simple part-time job.
What about the partner you were with?
Is he doing well?
He went back to
his hometown in Osaka.
I'm not sure about his current situation.
He hasn't been in touch since he went back.
Who was that again? Murata?
No, what was his name?
- Jay?
-Yes.
I don't know what happened to him.
Although I'm not qualified to say,
he's a very carefree person.
That's true.
But he's a lovely person.
I'm really worried he might
cause trouble everywhere he goes.
Could he have gone
back to his hometown?
Don't come closer.
Don't come closer, you're dirty.
First things first,
Today, the company
he runs is short on staff.
I was thinking if there's
a suitable job for you.
Do you know about
synthetic cannabinoids?
A dangerous drug?
It's not that bad, really.
It's 100% legal.
But everyone has a negative impression of it,
so no one dares to take it on.
I'm looking for someone like you,
someone with integrity.
You've sold marijuana before,
so you must have integrity, right?
But I've never been a drug dealer.
Come on, don't lie.
Forget it, it doesn't matter.
It's a simple job.
we will sell online
or have delinquent youths sell
it between seniors and juniors.
You'll just be responsible for delivery.
It's simple, right?
I'll pay you a high hourly wage.
But I have concerns a
bout this kind of thing...
What's wrong with you?
Didn't you come here looking for a job?
You must be in need of money too, right?
A man has to know how
to make money, you know?
Don't you have a Girlfriend too?
You won't look good if you're broke.
She'll be completely
disappointed in you, you know?
Am I right? Are you a man?
It's not a bad thing.
Let's make a big profit.
Once you have enough money,
you can quit.
Good. This is a congratulatory
gift for starting work.
Just a token of appreciation.
I'm not sure about this matter.
If you have work-related questions, ask Habu.
Good luck.
Hey, why don't you go and pour
a glass of juice for them too?
- Okay, I got it.
- Sorry, I'll do it.
It's okay, just sit there.
Sorry about that.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kawamoto.
Put it away quickly.
I'll help you with that.
Here, in our place,
Tattoos, earrings, beards, dyed hair,
none of it is a problem.
Everyone is like that.
I have a beard too, it's not a problem.
Here's your drink.
I'm really sorry.
Go ahead and drink.
You won't get caught, I guarantee it.
Don't worry, it's legal.
It tastes really good.
Please try it.
Top-grade beef.
Impressive, have some more sun.
Sure.
Rakuto, ordinary ones are fine.
The delicious meat tastes better, right?
That's true.
It's great that you found a job.
Yeah.
Can I eat this?
Wait a moment for this one.
You can eat this now.
No, I want this one.
He wants meat
more than sausages.
Rakuto, why don't you give it a try?
Don't look so puzzled.
You should know your product well.
This is work, you know.
Right?
- No, thanks.
- Don't you want to?
No, take a few more puffs.
Right?
One more...
One more...
Feeling nauseous?
Do you feel sick?
Do you feel sick?
Are you about to throw up?
No, you can't vomit here.
Wait, let's go to the restroom.
Can't be, let's go.
Are you okay?
Not good?
Not good, huh?
Not feeling too well.
Still want to throw up?
It's really bad.
Please come in.
It's spacious, isn't it?
- Very spacious, right?
- Yes.
Why don't you sit down
and take a look?
It's okay, the president said we can
use it as a staff dormitory.
Don't worry, madam.
Rakuto is a talented person.
Thank you.
Although it's a bit old,
I hope you don't mind.
Feel strange?
Don't you like it this way?
Did we force you?
No, it's not like that.
Because this house is too luxurious.
It's not like that,
don't worry.
Madam,
I wish you a happy new life.
That's it then.
- Rakuto, can you come here for a moment?
- Sure.
Your efforts don't matter at all.
I want you to show me results.
I'm really sorry.
It's about time.
Understood.
I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Rakuto.
- Can I trust you?
- Yes.
-Really?
-Yes.
Our opportunities are limited.
Even if we keep working non-stop,
we can't make big money, right?
In the end, we're just being
manipulated by the yakuza.
Do you think this should continue?
It shouldn't.
Right?
Listen carefully,
You're not allowed to escape.
I'll give you your share for today.
I'll take care of these things.
With this situation,
we'll soon have 10 million.
-After it's safe, I'll give you half.
-But...
I want to work during the day.
- What can we do?
-But it's always at night...
I understand what you mean.
But, I still have to take care of my kid.
I understand that, but Rakuto.
A man is in his element at night,
that's when we make the final move.
Right?
- Let's make a big profit.
- But...
Cheers.
I'll pour it myself.
Did you hear that?
She said she'll pour it herself.
Caught you.
I'm really sorry.
Sorry about that.
- Sota.
- What's up?
Sota, your phone is ringing.
Got it.
Isn't that Rakuto?
Long time no see.
Sorry, you must be busy, right?
It's okay.
How have you been?
I'm doing well.
I'm doing okay, I guess.
I'm working hard too,
although it's just as a security guard.
You work as a security guard?
But it puts my mind at ease.
I'll call you again.
How's Kusachan doing?
I'm doing well.
Now I'm a takoyaki shop uncle.
Oh, I see.
A takoyaki shop uncle, huh.
That suits you well.
I'm working diligently, you know.
By the way,
I'm really looking forward to it.
Looking forward to what?
Your birthday is coming up, right?
I didn't give you a gift last year.
You don't have to do that.
Instead of that,
don't push yourself too hard.
As long as you're doing well,
that's enough.
Yeah, it's great to chat with you.
But I'll definitely give you a gift.
I see.
Thank you.
I'll call you again too.
When I have free time,
I'll come and see you.
Yeah, you're always welcome in Osaka.
"Just treat this place as your hometown."
I'm serious.
Enjoy unlimited servings of delicious Okonomiyaki.
Thank you.
See you next time.
- Alright then.
- That's how it is.
Who is it?
You seem so happy.
It's my "Chicken Star."
What?
Alright,
let's get back to work.
Did he say it's a chicken?
But that's not a "see you next time."
It's not a real "see you next time."
(Thanks to Guke's 10th anniversary)
(Mikemai Ramen now priced at 520 yen)
(Transform your room into a starry sky)
(Indoor planetarium)
(Second generation code and association)
Alright.
I'm sorry, understood.
I understand.
My apologies.
This is awful.
I can see the bones. Climb out of the well
and take a look. This is too interesting.
It's a call from headquarters.
They're demanding our presence
at the regular meeting the day after tomorrow.
What a hassle. It's not like it's a training session.
They just want money, don't they?
They always take money from us,
the meager third branch.
We're just operating
as a franchise, that's all.
-Right?
- Yes.
You go to him.
No, that won't work.
It's not appropriate.
Let's forget about it for now.
Come and take a look at this.
This is a drug called "Crocodile."
Look at how it transforms after using it.
I heard it's popular in countries like Russia.
It's really intense.
Those spineless Japanese brats
would never dare touch it.
They're all cowards.
This dangerous drug suits them well.
They mix it with all sorts of
unknown toxic substances.
Those idiots buy it happily,
getting their brains fried and malfunctioning.
And why call it a dangerous drug?
Such a tacky name. It only makes
those foolish brats want to try it more.
It's like something
a candy store would sell.
This way, even elementary school kids
can get their hands on it.
But we should thank the higher-ups.
Thanks to them, we can make money.
- Look, the popsicles have changed like this.
- I'm sorry.
Alright, got it.
Rakuto.
Who is this for?
This is for my closest friend.
Closest friend?
How should I put it?
A trusted confidant.
Sun, you should write something too.
Write "Happy Birthday"
Should we use the method
of the black caterpillar again?
The caterpillar family is so disgusting.
We need to eradicate them completely.
Can we use this crocodile?
The whole family's hands and feet rot away.
But their faces look like this.
Mooimai, why don't you write something too?
- That's right.
- That's right.
What color do you want to use?
What color would be good?
How about green?
I want aquamarine.
Then let's go with aquamarine.
- Phone call.
- Hmm.
Aren't you going to answer?
It's for you.
Even though it's Sunday,
the president called.
Hung up.
We don't need to add anything here.
Wouldn't it be better to answer it?
Maybe it's something urgent.
Maybe.
Yes.
Rakuto?
Yes.
Are you free now?
I am.
- Sorry for calling on a Sunday.
- It's okay.
There's something
I want to talk to you about.
I happen to be in front of your house.
Shall we have a cup of tea together?
Okay.
Is that okay?
I understand.
You really said let's have tea.
You constantly poking me is dangerous.
- Tea is not a solution, you idiot.
- Let's not talk about it anymore.
It's really funny.
Rakuto must be scared to death.
open your mouth.
What are you doing?
Start crying already.
Stop it,
don't do this.
Stop getting in the way.
If he knows that kid's father is me,
I wonder what expression he would have.
I'm so looking forward to it.
By the way, with this,
Rakuto will be completely in our hands.
We can do whatever we want next.
That guy seems quite useful.
But that woman is really foolish.
Even though she's a heroin addict,
she offered me a million to stop.
It doesn't make any sense.
She took a bunch of heroin from me.
This will be the last time.
I'm sorry.
That woman is really stupid.
It's like a plot from a manga.
Even though I don't care
about her anymore,
when she suddenly said
she didn't want heroin,
I found it strange
and saw her with Rakuto.
- i forgot my phone
- what?
- Never mind
- what?
When I saw them together,
I thought, "Jackpot."
Wasn't that shortly after
he came for the interview?
He's really a foolish moth to a flame.
Hello?
No problem,
you're welcome anytime.
Pleased to meet you
Very well...
And then I saw him desperately
selling gastrointestinal medicine.
It's all rigged.
(Digestive and intestinal medicine)
Your efforts are irrelevant.
I'm asking you to show results.
Should we sell a little bit of drugs?
Like X, ecstasy pills.
- Hey.
- Yes.
Can you really harm your own child?
What are you talking about?
Of course, I can do it.
That's not my child,
it's Rakuto's child.
So, it's the worm's kid.
I just shot a few rounds in her vagina,
and he was born.
I'm an all-knowing, all-powerful god.
That's it.
This is a photocopy of the manuscript
I found in his room.
And then? Any clues?
There are hidden texts
that imply criminal acts.
Like "Sacred Punishment"
and "Day of Judgment," and so on.
"Holy Water" seems to refer to
sulfuric acid being sprinkled everywhere,
but it also contains urine as an ingredient.
There seems to be no grudge between
the murdered gangsters.
It's probably a random killing spree.
Rakuto?
Yes.
Are you available now?
I am.
(Kill the despicable humans)
What are you doing?
Hey, come over here.
Where are you?
Where are you? Momobei
(God's retribution)
Please spare me.
Please, spare me.
Say something quickly.
You despicable human.
Your name is Saotome, right?
- (God's retribution...)
- I have already investigated.
What is it called "Saotome"?
You're just a bald old man.
You wretched creature.
Are you trying to fool me?
I am a god.
I will report this at the regular meeting.
Hey, release me, will you?
Can you do that?
Just release my hands, or even my feet.
Either the hands or the feet, it doesn't matter.
Please, just release me, will you?
Really, just release me.
What are you doing?
Go find all the thugs lurking under Hatta.
Don't underestimate the yakuza. Seriously
The rest is up to you.
You've worked hard.
Great, you're safe now.
- Great.
- You can go home now.
Um, can you please release me?
Hey, don't speed.
One, two, three.
That's right,
let's continue like this.
Let's skip the cola cake,
sashimi is good.
- Run, run!
- What's wrong?
Run!
- What's wrong?
- Don't ask, just run!
Hurry up and pack up,
okay? It'll be fine.
- Happy birthday.
- You don't have to do that.
Why is it beef?
Usually, we have cake, right?
You're already a middle-aged man when you're 35.
Be careful with diabetes.
You're an important heir for us.
Have some steak to boost your energy.
Get married to a good wife
as soon as possible.
I know, you're so naggy.
Don't worry.
This guy's hairstyle...
He not only got married
but also lives happily.
- Really?
- So happy!
It feels interesting.
Sota go blow his hair.
Are you stupid?
This is not a toy.
It looks delicious, look.
By the way...
Is my package here today?
Huh? No, it's not.
Oh, I see.
Eat up, the meat is cooked.
It's good to be back.
Tida is always happy.
Rakuto.
Who brought so much water here?
It must be God.
Who's God?
What does he do?
It's hard to explain.
Do you feel warm here
when you think of your mom?
Yes.
Then that's God.
You didn't explain it clearly.
Everyone has a heart,
no matter who they are.
Heart?
It's a place that can become warm.
Look there, Tida.
The sun.
The name Tida means the sun.
- It's also God, right?
- It would be nice if it is.
Hey, Tida.
-sun.
-god.
Tida.
Rakuto.
Are you okay?
You look a bit exhausted.
There have been a lot of tiring things lately,
it's a bit overwhelming.
Are you feeling unwell?
I'll go rest, it's okay.
It's fine.
(Two years later, Okinawa)
The chicken that can't fly...
It flew up.
Sota.
He's here.
Thank you for coming all this way.
My name is Sota.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Originally, we planned to give you
a birthday present
on Sota's birthday together.
but…
a serious incident happened.
We escaped back to Okinawa like this.
So we couldn't bring the gift for you.
I bought the exact same thing.
today…
I brought it with me.
Can you please accept it?
Give this to your big brother.
It's the Planetarium.
Planetarium?
Also...
There's something else to give you.
Although he might get angry,
I think it's best to give it to Mr. Sota.
Even though he stopped drawing halfway.
(Chicken star)
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry
Sota,
I couldn't explain it properly to you.
Although I have a lot to say,
I'm just a fool.
I'm really sorry.
I...
I've never been able to forgive my mother.
I felt like she never protected me.
After my mother remarried, my stepfather...
He really is...
A scumbag.
I was beaten every day.
I'm sorry.
Day after day...
Every minute, every second,
I was so scared.
I always felt...
The world was so small.
Like being in a prison.
But you know,
I met Tsukimi in Okinawa.
We both hated our biological families.
It was like running away from home,
free and happy.
I've always liked her.
In Tokyo,
By chance, I ran into Tsukimi again.
Tsukimi?
Although at that time, Sota misunderstood.
The girl who got beaten
up in the park by me.
Are you kidding?
You're a mother, right?
Tsukimi has also been through a lot.
I tried my best too.
Cheer up.
Although I couldn't speak to Sota,
I didn't want to keep it from you.
I always felt like we were a family.
I also felt like I was a father.
Thinking, "So this is what a family is like.
I was really happy.
I know my time is running out.
So I didn't get married.
It's Hodgkin's lymphoma.
It has spread to my spleen.
I always feel...
I finally became a father with great difficulty,
and now I have to say goodbye.
Isn't it annoying?
So I chose to run away.
I'm really useless.
Although i didn't tell you.
I've always cherished this ring.
I, um... I really liked Tsukimi...
But I couldn't even manage to kiss her once.
Can you believe it?
It was really short-lived.
Chicken star can't shine.
It's a useless star.
Although I have this nature,
But it's great to meet Sota.
It's embarrassing to say this,
What are you doing? You fool.
But I've always felt that
you're like my big brother.
Being able to meet Sota and Tsukimi,
when I was lost in a dark world,
when I was happy,
when things were going terribly,
no matter when,
I felt like you were my home.
Goodbye.
What a loser.
How should I put it,
My heart feels like, "I'm back."
I, um...
I should have started my journey earlier.
but,
You should take it slow, really slow.
Take your time.
Laugh sometimes,
cry sometimes,
live your life to the fullest,
taste delicious food,
appreciate beautiful scenery,
be a good son to your parents.
I envy being able to
do all those things.
so,
please live on behalf of me too.
Survive.
And one day...
Let's meet again.
It's a promise.
I'll wait for you on the chicken Star.
Feels...
Like a farewell letter.
If it's the moon,
Feeling weary,
The stars will take care of lighting up.
If it's the stars,
Feeling weary,
The moon will take care of lighting up.
If it's the moon,
Crying,
The stars will smile for it.
If it's the stars,
Crying,
The moon will smile for it.
Sun,
From today, you're a dad.
Help Mom put on the ring.
- congratulations.
- congratulations.
Holding a wedding for someone
who's no longer in this world,
And I'm unexpectedly the matchmaker.
I never thought something like
this would happen in my life,
But somehow, it feels...
Like a wonderful thing.
Sun, let's go.
Here they are.
Mint?
Wait, what are you doing?
That's mine!
If you don't like it,
give it back to me.
Your companion,
Which star does he live on?
Is that the one?
I'm still looking.
I see.
I don't know who told me this,
But before a person is born,
A divine-like being
will come to tell you
That you have such
a fate and when you'll die,
And they'll ask you, "Despite that,
do you still want to meet that person?"
Those who answer "yes"
Will be born into this world,
And after being born,
Those memories will disappear.
Could it be the same for your partner?
Just to come and see you?
Then next time,
I'll have to go and meet him
Although not now.
Thinking this way,
Does the chicken Star really exist?
it exists.
It truly exists.
Do you think it all ends here?
No, it doesn't.
The rocket has been launched.
Is it true? Wow, we can see
the whole Earth from here.
Tsukimi and Tida asked me.
To fulfill the promise with
Rakuto and go to the moon.
Rakuto only gave me a rocket ticket.
And now, Tida has become
the world's top soccer player,
Replacing his father as a superstar,
And he gave me a ticket for a space trip,
Telling me to use it to find
the chicken Star on the moon.
It's really chaotic.
Me, an uncle who makes
Osaka-style okonomiyaki, ended up going to space.
Oh, life is full of unknowns.
I really didn't understand before.
This must be what he meant
by "Fucking Rock'N'Roll."
